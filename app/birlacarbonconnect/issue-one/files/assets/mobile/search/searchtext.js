These norms are expected to further develop over the coming years with a dynamic shift expected in the composition of tires and tire manufacturing over the next 10 years and beyond. Further, the future of “mobility” will no doubt be different utilizing competing drive trains of different technology to reduce emissions and improve fuel economy, whether from hydrocarbon-based fuels or electricity. Thus the passenger car market continues to be driven by fuel efficiency with beginnings of environmentalism as differentiators by car manufacturers and the growth and marketing of green/hybrid vehicles are growing stronger and louder (Sale of Green/Hybrid Cars). Today, “green” may still not be the overriding decision factor while purchasing an automobile, but it may not be too far out in the future. Fuel efficiency, driven by rising fuel costs may still be the primary decision factor, but the consumer is quick to deduce choosing higher fuel efficiency is also being an environmentally responsible consumer. So what role will tires play in driving and supporting the green technologies currently being sold and developed for the future? Research indicates that up to 20% of a vehicle’s fuel efficiency is impacted by its tires as imparted by the tires’ rolling resistance. At typical tire operating temperatures of approximately 60°C, this rolling resistance can be dictated by the tires’ heat buildup properties inherent in viscoelastic materials such as rubber, when reinforced with a reinforcing agent like Carbon Black. All components of a tire contribute to its “heat buildup properties”, but the tread, being in contact with road surface and undergoing more significant dynamic deformation, contributes >50% of a tire’s rolling resistance (see Figure 1 below). Thus it is extremely important to focus on the one compound with the highest heat buildup and rolling resistance to achieve differentiated performance for Tire Component Contribution to Rolling Resistance Figure 1 shows tire components and their relative contribution to rolling resistance. Note the tread compound is responsible for the majority of a tire’s rolling resistance. Most development work is geared toward reducing heat buildup in the tire tread compound. Tread Ply Belt Liner Sidewall Figure 1 Bead 10% 21% 57% 5% 5% 2% a tire. Low rolling resistance has been and has become an ever-increasing area of investment and technological development for tire manufacturers in all aspects of tire technology including design, construction and materials. Birla Carbon can play a role in the materials area and that is where our efforts have been focused – designing new composite technology for low rolling resistance (low heat buildup) tread compounds. Development of the Birla Carbon Solution for Green Tire Technology Since over twenty years ago when Michelin introduced the first patent for a low rolling resistance tire containing silica as a reinforcing agent, the use of silica has continued to grow and has now become a widely adopted technology by practically all major tire manufacturers. Numerous efforts by Carbon Black companies to find a suitable alternative have been unsuccessful, and silica use, while only about 5% of filler volume used in tire treads, has started to become a threat to our Carbon Black business. However, silica compounds are higher cost, take longer to mix and reduce a tire factory throughput dramatically. Considering all the above factors, a clear need/opportunity exists to provide a completely differentiated Carbon Black to counter the silica threat and improve Birla Carbon’s profitability, improve tire performance and our customers’ manufacturing throughput, cost structure and profitability. Understanding this need and envisioning this to be a primary driver of technological investments of the future, in 2008 the technology team at Birla Carbon proactively took up the challenge of finding a solution to this emerging need. Led by Dr. Charles Herd, the team adopted a unique approach for this project. Instead of collaborating with the tire manufacturers, the team reached out to three different material suppliers to the tire industry – a leading polymer manufacturer, and two other materials manufacturers outside the realm of Carbon Black and polymers, but that cannot be identified due to confidentiality agreements. The goal and strategy being that Carbon Black alone could not solve the problem, rather a combination of two unique materials would be required to achieve the truly differentiated performance needed for a green tire based on Carbon Black as a reinforcing agent as opposed to silica. What followed was a successful collab­ or­a­tion with the polymer manufacturer – Lanxess, a truly global player in the elastomer business for tire and non-tire applications, bringing together two unique materials – a surface-modified Carbon Black for rubber and a new technology elastomer designed by Lanxess that is a functionalized elastomer. With our extensive infrastructure in place, the team had all the requisite capabilities and equipment to undertake this development. The companies entered into a joint development Tire rolling resistance is directly related to the amount of wasted energy or fuel that a tire consumes when rolling under load due to repeated dynamic deformation and heat buildup in the tire.","@ID":8},{"#text":"11 10 An automated Customer Relationship Management system would aid in improved understanding and effective management of our global customer accounts. Furthermore, it was an opportunity to strengthen our position as the leading global Carbon Black company. With the leadership team on board for a new system, Jas Sandhu and Rahul Kohli were project sponsors for this initiative. Robert Means was given charge of the implementation of the initiative. A core project team comprising Mark Bass, Jose Dreux, Sandeep Arora, and Sven Zimmermann, supported by key internal IT resources, Morgan Bailey and Amit Sahu (who were responsible for coordination with other resources within the Birla Carbon IT organization), and external consultants kicked off the process with a three-week initiation meeting in Mumbai, India in August, 2012. What followed was a steady and streamlined rollout by adopting a multi- regional pilot phase which included a series of discussions outlining the project blueprint, Project Fusion has caused a visible buzz and excitement across the organization for the past few months! On March 25, 2013, a highly charged team of 55 people from 10 countries came together at the Marietta office to initiate the first phase termed “blueprint phase I”. A two-month process, this phase focuses on the process standardization and basis for defining the ERP. Phase I lasted six weeks.

We have truly demonstrated the Aditya Birla Group values of integrity, commitment, passion, seamlessness and speed. The Senior Management Team led by our COO Kevin Boyle has done a terrific job of creating a strong organization, robust processes and capable teams. I sincerely appreciate their contribution. While we have improved upon the Safety, Health and Environment performance, there is much more to be accomplished on this non-negotiable aspect. Similarly, as a B2B business, we need to deliver products of the highest quality backed by effective technical service to our customers. Neither SHE performance nor the product quality, or plant reliability can be achieved unless we adhere to the SOPs with discipline and commitment. We have learned a lot from specific events that have resulted in plant disruptions, unplanned downtimes, equipment failures and eventual business loss. I hope we have learned enough to ensure that we preempt these incidents that destroy value for us. We can fall short of our targets due to market volatility, but we should never suffer from things that are within our control. Let me turn to our future – particularly, to our vision and our strategy of the future. After all, our vision and strategy are the guiding lights that will shape the future of our global business. We are striving to become the Most Respected, Most Dynamic and the Most Sustainable global organization in the Carbon Black industry. That is our vision. As the leader of the sector, we need to set the standard and be the benchmark in each of these aspects. We will earn the highest Respect when we establish ourselves as the product and technology leader with our customers, aided by world-class processes and people. We need to earn similar respect from our employees, shareholders/investors and the communities in which we operate including the local governments by virtue of how well we create value for each of these stakeholders. We will be considered Dynamic when we are able to rapidly innovate and commercialize the fruits of such innovation. We have to create a culture of innovation leveraging our values of seamlessness and speed. Innovation has to be our way of dealing with cost and competitive pressures. Sustainability will be an outcome of our performance in the areas of Safety, Health and Environment, plant reliability, effective risk management and our ethical and responsible conduct as a business. Remaining profitable with better operating margins compared to our com­petitors will keep us – what our Chairman Mr. Birla calls – “The Last Person Standing.” I hope you will be excited about this vision and think of how you personally and your units and functions can contribute. This is a great responsibility for each and every member of the team, and it does not matter what your current role or rank is in the organization; you can contribute to this vision if you believe in it. Our actions and attitude can take us where we want to be. Our vision is backed by a well-thoughtthrough, long-term strategy centered around profitable growth in emerging markets; growing with our customers; diversifying our feedstock; growth in specialty black; investment into key technology; effective customer segmentation and key account management; co-creation with our customers; operational excellence through continuous improvement; and cost leadership through innovation. To enable these, we will also build a strong talent base and capability in our people. Our ability to attain our vision and deliver our strategy will depend on all of us – how we act, interact, our abilities and attitude. I call upon all of you to make continuous improvement and innovation an integral part of our culture. If you have an idea for improvement, please bring it to the attention of your manager or anyone you are comfortable with. No idea is small. No effort insignificant! I expect a high level of interaction and connectivity across regions, units and functions with a spirit to share our knowledge and experience. Remember One Birla Carbon is not and cannot be a solo act. These are exciting yet challenging times. There will be occasions for elation and there will be moments of frustration. We need to ignore these momentary swings and stay focused on the long-term vision of our business. We will be tempted by short cuts and easy options. But we must not waiver from our values and we must always do the right thing. That will always earn us respect wherever we operate. We are a truly global business with people from many cultures and backgrounds. We need to respect and celebrate that. This diversity has to be the source of our strength and innovation. Our varied cultures and languages can be barriers but need not diminish our communication and camaraderie. We are also fortunate to have a strong parent organization in the Aditya Birla Group, and I would urge you all to learn more about it, access its resources, and leverage its size and diversity to advance your knowledge and your career.

What emerged was a new composite material described as the Birla CarbonLanxess-Composite (BCLC); that is comprised of a unique surface-modified rubber Carbon Black, CD2125XZ and the Lanxess functionalized solution-styrenebutadiene (SSBR) elastomer, PBR4088. This powerful combination results in dramatically improved carbon-blackelastomer interaction and reduced Carbon Black networking to achieve significantly lower heat buildup and rolling resistance in summer tire tread compounds, practically matching that of silica. Additionally, this new functionalized rubber grade Carbon Black appears to have the ability to serve as a “technical platform” in its current form or with other surface modifications to optimize the Carbon Black elastomer interaction in conjunction with other specialty functionalized solution SBR elastomers, broadening its potential in a wider array of elastomers and performance ranges, not achievable with standard Carbon Blacks today. Says Dr. Charles Herd, “Working with another company outside of the tire industry but one who supplies the tire industry in such a collaborative manner was invigorating and illuminating, bringing a fresh perspective to the daunting task of truly reaching new levels of performance in heat buildup reduction for Carbon Black. The teamwork within and between our companies simply has been fantastic. The synergy between Carbon Black and elastomer manufacturers is very obvious and will be further exploited as we con­ tinue to develop the composite technology approach to meet the ever-increasing demands placed upon us as a supplier and as a responsible manufacturing entity in global society as a whole.” The Birla Carbon-Lanxess-Composite – The Path Forward The virtues of this product/ process were immense in not only potentially supplying a carbon-black-based solution to lowering rolling resistance, but also providing our customers with energy savings and increased tire throughput. For example, the learnings from the study showed that the BCLC: Lowers compound cost as the BCLC does not require expensive silane for coupling the reinforcing agent to the elastomer as is required for silica Provides easy dispersion for potentially shorter mixing cycles and lower energy costs Increases factory throughput and lowers energy costs versus silica-based compounds and does not require special equipment to handle the capture of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are emitted when silica-silane systems are used Prevents premature wear of factory rubber mixers as silica is much more abrasive than Carbon Black during mixing and extrusion All of these factors provide tremendous potential for cost savings for our customers, as feedback from the marketplace tells us that our customers truly prefer a simpler, better processing and higher throughput solution over silica To introduce the product, the team followed a steady and systematic approach. Steve Crossley, Rubber Lab Manager of Birla Carbon and Judy Douglas, Technical Marketing North America of Lanxess first presented a joint paper to the Rubber Division of American Chemical Society towards the end of 2011 post optimization and validation of the process. In November 2012, Dr. Charles Herd on behalf of Birla Carbon, presented a webinar at the Rubber World Conference and invited the global tire companies. In addition, the RCB Product Technology team has been aggressively promoting the product during 2012 and 2013 to our tire customers in all regions of the world. In response there has been a very high degree of interest expressed by our customers in this product and currently samples have been sent to these global tire customers in the first and second quarter of 2013. While the validation of the performance is awaited from the customers, the set-up for large scale trial and commercialization continues by the team internally. Says Lester Tyra, “We expect that this breakthrough product will generate additional interest across the tire industry and eventually may lead to some strategic development efforts to support commercializing a low rolling resistance solution. Our approach has been unique and has caught the interest of the major players as a possible alternative to silica.” A five-year effort, this project was a key platform to demonstrate our technological edge and truly encompasses all aspects of the vision to be the Most Respected, Most Dynamic and Most Sustainable Carbon Black business globally.

Some of you also realize that Birla Carbon has initiated a sustainability initiative of its own. I hope to answer some of the questions you may have about the objective and implementation of our sustainability program At Birla Carbon we have decided to focus on three main pillars of sustainability: people, planet andprofit. For us, sustainability means doing the right things to protect the availability of natural resources that we consume in an efficient manner in a way that minimizes any harm to the environment around us. It means we must hire, train and develop our employees and also protect not only our people but also those with whom we come into contact such as contractors and our local communities. Finally, we must do all of these things in a profitable manner that allows us to continue to be a financially viable partner with our customers. You may say at Birla Carbon we have been taking these steps for years so why are we choosing to focus on them under the umbrella of sustainability? It is our hope in doing so that it will enable our business to ensure that our business strategies are always in line with these ideals, and also permit us to highlight the many positive things that we are doing in these areas to distinguish ourselves from our competitors. By clearly focusing on these factors and clearly communicating both our accomplishments and our challenges we believe we will be able to differentiate Birla Carbon from other Carbon Black manufacturers in the eyes of our customers, employees, communities, regulators and financial markets. We are approaching this sustainability initiative with a clear sense of our past successes and a clear commitment to transparently communicate our successes, our goals and our challenges. We believe that transparency will continue to drive accountability and that accountability will drive excellence.

If you read Kevin Boyle’s note of November 2012, you will also know that I have been appointed Chief Sustainability Officer for the Birla Carbon business, and that I have selected Gilles Moninot as the Director of Sustainability. Gilles has assembled a team of professionals from inside and outside of the Birla Carbon business to serve as the Sustainability Steering Committee to assist in defining and guiding our sustainability journey. We have expertise on the Steering Committee from human resources, technology, health and safety, engineering, legal, environmental affairs, operations, marketing and communications. In the future we will be adding team members from finance and procurement. This team has been very busy defining the scope of our sustainability program, developing methods to capture all of the necessary data in a robust and sustainable way that can be replicated in coming years, and, together with the senior management team, defining clear ambitious sustainability goals. The efforts of the Sustainability Steering Committee will come together in the form of a comprehensive sustainability report that will tell the story of Birla Carbon and Carbon Black in a way that we think will give us an advantage in the recruitment of top human talent, help define us as the preferred supplier of Carbon Black to our customers, establish us as a best-in-class manufacturer in the eyes of our regulators and the communities in which we operate, and distinguish us as a preferred investment choice for the financial community. The first Birla Carbon sustainability report will be published in July, 2013 and we have committed to publish a report annually thereafter. We will continue to enhance our report each year by doing such things as tracking the entire life cycle of our resources and our products, reporting on ongoing and newly established goals and showing progress in the areas where we are not performing at the level that we desire. The entire sustainability team is very excited about this inaugural report, and we are hopeful that you, our colleagues, will be excited as well when you see this first report.

Tyra Rubber Carbon Black Product Technology It’s a well-known fact that over 70% of the world’s Carbon Black is consumed by the tire industry. As a major consumer of the world’s raw materials, this industry has been under tremendous pressure over the last few decades to balance performance and cost. There are ever-increasing demands in the tire industry to improve rolling resistance, traction and fuel economy while maintaining tire safety and affordability. As governments across the world are faced with expanding markets and growing economies, within or outside of their regions, and the benefits they bring, they also have to ensure that progress is sustainable and its impact on the environment is minimized. As such, choices are being made and policies being put in place regarding increasingly stringent fuel economy standards, tougher environmental standards regarding CO 2 emissions, demanding tire labeling schemes and promotion of sustainability as a key focus of corporate boards. As these and many more factors are impacting the global automobile industry, the impact is thus felt by global tire understanding the user requirements, and overcoming the initial concerns on the system implementation. Based on the experience and feedback of the early adopters, the requisite changes were made to the process. This was followed by extensive training for all the users.

However, we face a growing threat to our business. When everyone in Carbon Black competed based on the price of U.S. Gulf Coast feedstock, the playing field was level. Small differences in efficiency or cost provided a competitive advantage. With the rapid growth of Chinese Carbon Black production based not on U.S. Gulf Coast prices but Chinese coal tars, a dra­­matic shift in the competitive landscape occurred. We have seen the impact of this shift in many of our markets, like India, where despite overcapacity by the domestic producers, impor­ ted Carbon Black accounted for nearly 20% of the market last year. Such a dramatic shift means that we can no longer look for small improvements to provide a comfortable position. We must push our operations to become more flexible and more efficient. We must engage with our customers to maximize the value for both them and us. Relying on U.S. Gulf Coast feedstock is no longer an option. Therefore, we must aggressively pursue better value feedstocks Birla Carbon Connect Birla Carbon Connect COO Address COO Address wherever economical. This means taking the knowledge inherent in Birla Carbon to push the boundaries of our current operations to obtain the lowest total cost feedstock. Driving yield higher is critical to our success. Rapid implementation of known technology is critical to achieving results. We must continue to build trust that “if it works in that facility, then I can make it work here.” In addition, to be efficient, we must take some risks on feedstock inventory. The times where we could easily afford to run with full tanks and full silos are over. Efficient means lean, so we reduce our exposure to volatile pricing in these uncertain times. SAP will help us by providing a common tool for analyzing our performance. Energy is a critical cost component for our facilities. Given our surplus in many facilities, we sometimes forget how much impact energy can have on our results. If our sites have a surplus, then the more efficient we are directly improves our revenue as we will be able to sell more. In sites where we are buying energy, being more efficient means fewer purchases and better results. Customer engagement is critical to correctly value the products we make. Recent surveys with our customers highlight how far we have to go to be viewed as the leader by our customers. Just because we have the most capacity does not automatically make us the leader. As the leader, we need to set the standard in our markets for pricing and performance. In specialty blacks, we have the added challenge of growing our position to a leadership role in the market. We have just started on this journey. Finally, as fitting the leader in our industry, we have established sustainability goals for ourselves relative to our stakeholders. It is our duty to ourselves and our families and those around us to operate in a safe manner. It means being a good citizen of the communities in which we operate. It means providing a long-term, stable business to provide a secure workplace for our employees, a steady supplier to our customers, and an economic return for the investment by our shareholders. This journey will take the sustained efforts of everyone in the Carbon Black business. Given the continued commitment of everyone on the team, I am confident that we will be successful in our journey.
