This diversity is as much a strength as a weakness − an example of which is when aligning the way we operate across plants. In our efforts to align quality processes across our plants, the position of Regional Quality Director was created in early 2012. We wanted to operate in a way such that everybody at each site fulfilled the procedures in exactly the same way, i.e., the best way. This is called standard work in LEAN manufacturing. Simultaneously, our region has challenged itself to become the leader in carbon black quality. This is necessary because our customer usually will not buy our product based just on price. They will turn to our region when they are looking for high quality. Hence, we started our journey to become the highest quality producer of carbon black. Today, I want to share with you six examples of how we are improving our processes. 1. Regional Quality Organization We created a new regional quality organization. The Quality Director (QD), five Quality Managers (QM) and two Technical Service Managers have a conference call every month to discuss quality topics such as complaints, specifications, new procedures, upcoming audits, test equipment, etc. Twice a year the QD and QM meet off-site for two days to discuss quality in more depth. As an example, the next meeting will focus on ISO/TS 16949 implementation, rubber testing in the region, measurement system analysis and supplier management. We are also inviting colleagues from overseas to participate and get insight from our corporate technical experts. All our QMs will join or already have joined a professional national quality organization such as the German Society for Quality (DGQ). We want our QMs to be exposed to the experts in the field of Quality and Statistics. Each producing site is audited once per year by the QD and an accompanying QM from a sister site.

It constantly strives to provide each one of them with a safe and stimulating working environment, a real sense of involvement with the business and the opportunity to fulfill their potential. With this vision in mindMs. Nicole Kiehne, Director Supply Chain, Europe & Africa, wanted to do something for the women workforce in her region. She noticed that despite women being highly educated and possessing unique competencies, they were rare in management positions. She believed that if a platform could be created where women could share knowledge and best practices with each other, it would not just enhance their education but also develop leadership competencies in them. She thinks that this would open up a whole new world of opportunities for them. With this thought process in mind she introduced her plans of setting up a Women’s Network to the other women colleagues in her region. She explained to them the new platform would help them build relationships that are the groundwork for the future. She explained that “It is all about sharing what we are learning, reaching out to each other as thought partners and having more access to best practices within Birla Carbon”. One of the major reasons she thinks that this group would be a huge success is the sheer fact that women have a selfless approach and they think from a perspective like “What can I do for her in order to get what I need” rather than simply “What can this person do for me”. She started the entire process by taking one step at a time. She recruited volunteers from each site for becoming the local contact and coordinator for all activities. Currently May Mansour from Egypt; Ildikó Barkóczi from Hungary; Susanne Bartsch from Germany; Judith Tarjani from Italy andElena Campuzano from Spain form a part of her team. All these primary local contacts are involved in detail planning and sharing activities. The group has already met once, where they got to know each other better and shared with each other areas of interest collected from their region. They also discussed other ways of connecting and communicating with the women in their region. They are currently in the process of creating content for the intranet page and a suitable logo for the initiative. Nicole has huge plans for the group which would help all the women workforce at Birla Carbon Europe & Africa region to advance their careers and ultimately benefit the organisation. We wish her initiative great success.

And as much as we can, we align and benchmark our measurements to industry standards. When we see that we have low performance versus the benchmark, we are happy: We have found an opportunity to improve by “stealing with pride” – a practice that yields better results! We call this process “Balance scorecard benchmarked targets”. Our region’s members are committed to helping each other. We have professionals, managers and experts continuously travelling and being seconded to other locations, to either learn a proven good practice, or help fix a poor process, and the company is committed to helping our team members, by providing cutting-edge training and learning opportunities. We believe that if we stay put, our knowledge will become obsolete, and with it our quality, our products and ourselves. This quest for quality in product has yielded superb results as you will see in some of the highlighted stories. But it also has provided for financial results. This year the region will be generating revenues of US$ 655 Million with 429 KMT of carbon black sold. This will come with US$ 85 Million of EBITDA and US$ 90 Million of cash to the organization. Since 2008 the region has almost doubled Return on Revenue to 13%. More importantly, the region has learned to lower its breakeven point significantly − we can produce 90 KMT less than in 2010 and still generate the same earnings as in 2010. This is helping us to weather a soft market better than the competition and will position us for strong earnings growth the moment demand picks up. I hope you will find our other stories entertaining and inspiring. We are happy to share. We became masters of stealing with pride... as well as giving with an open heart!

The focus was on sales order management areas, with the target to reach better predictability and improve customer service. Announcement letters were sent to our customers outlining the content of the business policies, to further give a detailed introduction of these policies, and sales representatives visited them and explained the benefits of this process. The customer service team is responsible for implementing and monitoring the policies at the time of order receipt. The team is in close contact with customers to inform and explain if surcharges based on business policies have to be applied and how they can avoid it. These policies have been received well by our customers and the majority of them have integrated them into their order behavior, gaining the benefits of improved planning, and the reduction of administrative rework and ad hoc decisions. For some, their business strategy supports the payment of surcharges to remain, with full flexibility where we see compensation of our costs associated with the special requirements. We have also contacted small and large customers and we work closely with the local tire industry, as well as with others, to align their order management with our business policies to improve their internal processes. Overall the business policies are seen as a tool to ensure reliability and not as selling a value-added service. Customers have acknowledged that adhering to our business policies provides benefits for their daily work. Note: For the time being, the business policies do not apply to shipments from Egypt. The region developed business policies to improve the planning reliability, and reduce administrative rework and ad hoc requirements both for our customers and ourselves. The key initiatives were: Lead-time: A standard lead-time of 12 weekdays was announced where the company guarantees execution, assuming material and truck availability as well as administrative work are within regular process flow. For a delivery requested for immediate arrival, a surcharge would be applied. Order changes and cancellation: If a customer requests order changes and cancellations within the pre-defined timeframe, the company guarantees execution without extra cost. If the request is placed with short notice, a surcharge would be applicable. Full truckload: A minimum volume order per truck is requested. If the loading weight is less than required, a minimum surcharge would be applicable.

The staff of Asphalt, a nonprofit publishing company, celebrated the inauguration of their new offices in a Grand Opening Ceremony with 100 guests, including the Prime Minister of the State of Lower Saxony, Stephan Weil, and the acting Mayor of the City of Hannover, Bernd Strauch. For 20 years Asphalt has published a monthly street newspaper, which was started as real help for self-help. One hundred fifty people with no or very little income − many of whom are or used to be homeless − sell this magazine on the streets. The 25,000 monthly copies are distributed exclusively by direct selling, and subscriptions are available only from one of the salesmen or saleswomen. As part of our social commitment, the team of Birla Carbon Germany has become a strong supporter of Asphalt. As a first initiative, Birla Carbon is now a proud sponsor of two signs posted at the entrance of the main building guiding visitors to the new offices.

Birla Carbon Hannover Plant Hosts Open Day 2013 On October 12th, the Hannover Team hosted the second Open Day event at CCD. The plant opened its gates for everyone interested in how carbon black is made. And despite heavy rainfall, CCD enjoyed tremendous feedback from officials as well as private visitors. In the presence of the first mayor of Hannover, Stefan Schostok; the District Major, Klaus Dickneite; members of the city council and representatives of the police and fire departments, Oliver Sedello, General Manager of the Hannover Plant, opened the day and introduced the guests to the history of the plant and the process of making carbon. Thanks to the kind support of several suppliers, activities for children and grown-ups were available around the event tent, which was set up in the middle of the plant. The fire brigade showed its latest acquisition: an extendable 35 m high mobile rescue platform. A local gas and electricity supplier contributed a number of electric powered vehicles and the visitors clearly enjoyed driving a couple of Segways®. A definite highlight, not just for the young generation, was a real TEREX® excavator ready to be operated by the visitors. Throughout the day around 160 people participated in 14 plant tours organized by Philipp Nagy, QA Manager, in Hannover.","@ID":12},{"#text":"15 Birla Carbon Connect Europe & Africa Initiatives Santander, Spain Columbian Carbon Spain S.L Carretera Gajano-Pontejos Gajano-Pontejos 39792 GAJANO-Cantabria Apartado 283, Spain Contact No.: (34) 9425 03030 Plant Started: 1967 Capacity (Annual): 73,000 MT Unit Head: Jacinto Zarca Employee Strength: 63 Production Capability: • Tread (2 Units), Carcass (1 Unit) • MRG and plastic purposes • Ultra and low PAH Awards/Milestones: • Best Michelin IQPs in the Company • Demonstrated capacity to produce low PAH • Running tread APH at 900 °C Unique Features: • Only plant in Spain producing carbon black • Only plant that produces ultra grades and XT 1004 in EMEA • Only plant running an industrial tread reactor above 2000 °C • Number One in Best Practices ranking in Birla Carbon • Only plant in Birla Carbon running a WHB with two tread reactors Trecate, Italy Columbian Carbon Europa Srl Via S Cassiano 140 28069 San Martino di Trecate (NO) Italy Contact No.: (39) 0321 7981 Plant Started: 1959 Capacity (Annual): 88,000 MT Unit Head: Giuseppe Zanotti Fragonara Employee Strength: 79 Production Capability: • Tread (2 Units), Carcass (1 Unit) • Raven PFEB Awards/Milestones: • By Sincert: November 2005 • By CertiQuality: latest, March 2009 • Pirelli Award: Best Supplier 2011 • First Carbon Black plant in the world to have QS 9000 Unique Features: • Project “At-Risk Behavior” • Red Tag Day • “Muda”’s projects Tiszaújváros, Hungary Columbian Tiszai carbon LLC H-3581 Tiszaújváros P.O.

Certificate of Analysis We have created a new certificate of analysis (COA) that takes into account the perspective of the customer. The new COA fulfils the European Norm for COAs, EN 10204:2004 (yes, there is a norm for COAs!) and it states so. It has a designated contact person with name, phone number and e-mail address. Now the customer knows whom to contact in case there is a question. Instead of using cryptic abbreviations for the test parameters (for example, I2 on the old COA), now the individual test methods are spelled out (iodine adsorption number). To avoid using an outdated specification for a COA, the specification date and issue number are mentioned. A customer will first judge the quality of our product by our COA and the quality of the accompanying documentation. Therefore, a COA needs to look immaculate. If we do not care about the way our COAs look, we give the customer the impression that we may also not care much about the product itself. 5. Customer Michelin, a valuable and the largest customer, is also the most demanding one in terms of the quality. This is exactly the kind of customer we want, who will help us produce better carbon black. Michelin evaluates the performance of our product via IQP (Indicator of Product Quality). By comparing four fundamental rubber properties with a designated carbon black, our product receives an IQP rating. Based on this rating, Michelin decides to buy more or less of our product. With an IQP 100 rating, our product can be used by Michelin to 100% in their formulation. Our region, with the support of Charles Herd, Ranjan Ghosal, George Joyce, Steve Crossley, Mel Henry, Tina Rushing and others, has engaged in a project to improve our understanding of IQP. The table of the European sites below shows the progress our team has been making in 2013. Most importantly, today 80% of all our European Michelin grades have an IQP rating of either 75 or 100. This is the best performance since 2009 (in 2009, Michelin changed the way IQP was evaluated by including scorch and hysteresis in the analysis). For the first time ever we meet Michelin’s IQP requirement. Michelin has a target of IQP > 50 of at least 80%! 6. World Class Manufacturing or WCM WCM is a holistic approach to drive business performance, looking at all processes and stakeholders − from the vision of the leadership to the societal satisfaction − to improve the results of the organization.

Said differently, in such a diverse environment, how do you define your business identity? Here, I find it apt to quote from a very famous book Competitive Strategy, written by M. E. Porter in 1980, where he develops the idea that profitable and growing businesses are characterized by offering strong differentiation in only three clusters. 1. A company is a price leader, i.e., its products are always the lowest price on the market. 2. A company is a product leader, i.e., its products are the best, the coolest, the freshest and the fastest. 3. A company is a quality leader, i.e., its products are the most reliable, dependable, durable, responsible and sustainable. After having spent time in order to understand what we wanted to be, and perhaps more importantly, what our customers wanted Birla Carbon Europe & Africa to be, we decided that we needed to continuously work on being more and more the quality leader. Now, to be clear, being the quality leader does not mean that you can let your cost get out of control and your product become obsolete. But it means that we want to be unbeatable in quality and service. This value proposition is what makes Birla Carbon unique, identifiable by our business partners, and universal in the context of our diversity. The third pitfall is the belief that quality is costly. Sometimes people believe that they can do things less expensively if they cut corners on quality. The Hackett Group has developed very solid data that shows clearly that quality and cost are improved side by side. You cannot be cheap and have high quality; likewise, if you are high quality, you are typically low cost. In fact, “purposeful quality”, i.e., quality that matters to the customers, is about the relentless hunt for non-value-added activities, the ones that the customer does not want to pay for, and the stubborn quest for simplification. We call this Shutting Down the Hidden Factories. The Management Culture and the Management Tools Over the years, through intensive training and coaching, we have created a culture in the management teams of always asking the following questions, in order to discover hidden factories and assumptions: “Why has it got to be so complicated?” and “How do you know that?” It typically takes five whys and three how’s to get to the bottom of things and be able to act and simplify processes. But culture without tools is incantation. So we measure all that we do. From customer satisfaction, to spares turnover, to lab test Birla Carbon Connect Eric Gregoire Letter …we needed to continuously work on being more and more the quality leader.” Being a quality leader is a tough game. It involves crossing two elements and the avoiding the third pitfall:  1. Understand the elements that create quality in product and service, in the eyes of the customer.  2. Create a relentless execution process, from the top down to all levels of the organization, focused on quality and service.","@ID":4},{"#text":"17 Birla Carbon Connect Regional Highlights Customer Outing A three-day customer outing was organized at “The Greenbrier,” in White Sulphur Springs.

Each laboratory is assessed in seven categories: safety, cleanliness, order, standard work, equipment management, visual management and continuous improvement. We want our analysts to work in a clean workspace, as their work will be of higher quality. When visiting our laboratories, our customers have only one way of judging the quality of our test results. They will form an opinion through the way the laboratory looks. Is it clean and well ordered, or is it dirty and cluttered?
